think about SIGALRM for qmail-send to run everything
think about SIGHUP for qmail-send to reread locals, virtualdomains
make a non-/bin/sh version of program delivery
have maildir2smtp produce bounces, tnx TG, MD
think about ways to deal with SIOCGIFCONF stupidity, tnx MD
maybe give qmail-lspawn power to disable program deliveries in qmail-alias
in version 1.00 and following, allow free distribution
do some serious coverage testing, preferably under Purify, without alloc slop
replace INTERNALS with a real paper describing qmail
rewrite everything from scratch
